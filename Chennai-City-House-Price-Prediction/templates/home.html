    <h1 class="card-title">Importance of Home</h1>
    <p>Having a safe & secure place for residence makes it easier to achieve life goals.
      People believe “Home is where the heart is”. There is no place like home and over the centuries people made homes for themselves.
      Home is the shelter and the gathering place for everyone. Your home reminds you of your own deepest values and hopes and inspires you to realize them.</p>
      <p> Importance of Home </p> 
      <p>Home !!</p> 
      <p> It’s a primary need for everyone. The person is recognized by his or her home. It provides us better security, privacy etc. It’s a place where people love you, care for you. A vault where memories are kept.
      Our connection to home is the basic thread in our lives that pops up automatically in casual conversion. When we purchase a home we look for it to pride us comfort, healthy atmosphere. A place where we can feel safe and relax. We invest not only in the house but in our dreams and hopes also.</p>
